Overview
The app is a simple quiz game that presents a series of multiple-choice questions to the user. The user can enter their name and email address to begin the quiz, and their score is stored in a Supabase database after completion.

Technologies Used
The app is built with React, using the create-react-app tool to set up the initial project structure. The app also uses the following libraries and services:

Supabase: A backend-as-a-service platform that provides a PostgreSQL database and API for data storage and retrieval.
react-csv-parse: A library for parsing CSV data in a React application.
react-countdown-circle-timer: A component for displaying a countdown timer in a circular format.
Project Structure
The app's code is organized into several components, each of which handles a specific part of the app's functionality. Here's a brief overview of each component:

App
The App component is the top-level component for the app. It manages the overall state of the app and renders the other components as necessary. It fetches the quiz questions from a Google Sheets spreadsheet and passes them down to the Quiz component. It also handles the user's name and email input and stores the user's quiz score in the Supabase database after completion.

Quiz
The Quiz component is responsible for displaying the quiz questions and collecting the user's answers. It receives an array of question objects as a prop, each of which contains the question text, an array of possible answer options, and the index of the correct answer. The component uses React state to keep track of the user's selected answer for each question and updates the score accordingly. Once the quiz is complete, the component calls the onQuizCompleted callback function passed down from the App component with the final score.

Question
The Question component is a child component of the Quiz component that renders an individual quiz question. It receives a question object as a prop and displays the question text and answer options. It also handles the user's selection of an answer and updates the state accordingly.

UserForm
The UserForm component is responsible for rendering the form where the user enters their name and email address to begin the quiz. It also displays the top scores from the Supabase database. It uses React state to keep track of the user's name and email input and passes them to the App component when the user submits the form.

Timer
The Timer component is responsible for rendering the countdown timer that appears during the quiz. It uses the react-countdown-circle-timer library to display the timer in a circular format.

Conclusion
That's a high-level overview of the app's structure and functionality. I hope this helps you understand how everything fits together!
